# Docker---NodeJs

# Dockerized Node.js Application

This project is a simple Node.js application that is fully containerized using Docker. It uses Docker and Docker Compose to automate the setup and running of the application, ensuring it works seamlessly across different environments. 

## Features
- Node.js app running inside a Docker container
- Easy deployment using Docker Compose
- Automated dependency installation via `npm`
- Scalable and extendable for more services (e.g., databases)

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (for containerization)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (to manage multi-container apps)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (to clone the repository)

## Getting Started

### Installation

To get this project running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
Ensure Docker is installed on your machine and is running.

Install dependencies (if needed): If you are running the app outside of Docker for development purposes, use npm to install the dependencies.

bash
Copy code
npm install
Running the Application
Option 1: Using Docker Compose
Build and start the containers using Docker Compose:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
After the containers are up, you can access the Node.js app by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

Option 2: Using Docker Directly
Build the Docker image manually:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t node-docker-app .
Run the container using Docker:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 3000:3000 node-docker-app
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the app running.

Project Structure
The project follows a simple structure to keep everything organized:

perl
Copy code
docker-node-app/
├── docker-compose.yml      # Docker Compose configuration
├── Dockerfile              # Docker configuration for the Node.js app
├── main.js                 # Main Node.js file (application logic)
├── package.json            # Lists dependencies and metadata for the project
├── package-lock.json       # Locks dependency versions
└── node_modules/           # Installed dependencies (auto-generated)
Dockerfile Breakdown
The Dockerfile defines how the Docker image is built for this Node.js app:

Base Image: Starts from an Ubuntu base.
Node.js Installation: Installs Node.js using NodeSource and installs the app's dependencies.
App Files: Copies the project files (main.js, package.json, etc.) into the Docker container.
Install Dependencies: Runs npm install to set up the dependencies.
Run the App: The app is run using the command node main.js.
docker-compose.yml Breakdown
The docker-compose.yml file orchestrates the app's container.
It can be easily extended to add more services (e.g., databases, caches).
How to Extend the Project
This project is just a simple Node.js app, but you can extend it by adding:

A database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL
Caching using Redis or Memcached
Additional microservices
